### Hi there 👋


I am an aspiring software engineer with deep interests in Full-stack web development and software engineering.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on an [Artbook Generation Project](https://github.com/kaiwen98/artbook_generator)! It currently generates a PDF compiling submissions towards a Google Form.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Structures & Algorithms, CI/CD and LXC Virtualization.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Open Source Projects, particularly in Web development.
- 💼 I have worked for [GovTech](https://www.tech.gov.sg/), and [Amaris AI](https://www.amaris.ai/).
- ❤️ I believe strongly in bonding a community through software for the greater good. It shows in my project contributions!
